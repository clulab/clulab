# The power of literatures from my experience:
   - For 90% of ideas that you come up with, there are already papers about that (for the rest 10%, 8% are probably because the idea is not doable, 2% are because it is doable and nobody has explored. That 2% are usually because of newly available methods/techonology, such as large language models, or new data). 
   - For 90% of your questions (e.g., what types of information does the word embeddings capture), there are already papers about it. For the rest 10%, it might be good research topic of your paper. 

# Passive literature feeding:
   - For many times, you do not look for papers, but they are fed to you, these include:
   - Subscribe your research topic in google scholar and arxiv. There will be literatures fed to you.
   - Follow the big names on twiiter.
   - Your collegues might also share papers. 

# To get familiar with the hottest research topics:
   - Look at the tutorials of the top conferences (ICLR, ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, COLING, IJCAI, AAAI, SIGIR).
   - Look for the blogs (medium, towardsdatascience) or discussions (quora/reddit/twitter) with some keywords (e.g., transformers).
   - Look for review papers. 
   - Go though the publication list of the top NLP conferences (ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, COLING)
   - Note that when going through the publications lists, most of the papers are not very related. Usually only look at the papers that (1) are directly in your field of research (2) are highly likely to be used to your research. These two criteria should filter out more than 95% papers. E.g., if a conference accept 600 papers, then more than 570 papers should be directly filtered out. 
   - **Assignment:** by looking at the tutorials in 2010 and 2020, what techinqiues are disappearing and what are emerging?

# To look for papers of a particular topic:
   - Start with the keywords of that topic. E.g., "transformers", "multi-hop reasoning", "commonsense reasoning", etc. 
   - Google scholar supports complex keyword search. For example, the query `transformers for "multi-hop reasoning"` will return the ariticles that must have "multi-hop reasoning" but not necessarily "transformers". However, if "transformers" appears in the article, it will be ranked highers.
   - Searching by keywords might omit some articles, because (1) sometimes the same concept is expressed in a different way (2) there are some keywords that you don't know. 
   - So, for each article you get, do the following (1) look at the papers it cites (2) look at the papers that cite it (3) look at the paper's author's other papers. 
   - Repeat the previous step for 2 or 3 hops, then the literature review is pretty exhaustive. 
   - In the citations, usually only 20%-30% are highly related citations. For example, a paper is cited 20 times, so only about 4-6 papers are highly related. So we don't have to go through all the papers really carefully. 
   - **Assignment:** List the papers of one research topic in your area. 

# The most effective way to catch up with the research in your area:
   - Follow the work of the groups that work in the field. 
   - How to know which groups: see the techniques in "To look for papers of a particular topic".
   - **Assignment:** List 5 the most related research groups in your area.
