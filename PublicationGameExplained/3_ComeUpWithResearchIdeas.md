# General Principles of Coming up with Research Ideas:
   - The fastest (and the most reliable) way of coming up with research topics: read (the latest) papers in the field. 
   - The major types of research in NLP:
      1. New problems:
          + New problem becuase of new available technology. E.g., the emergency of crowdsourcing enables a lot of new datasets. 
          + New problem because of the shortcomings of the current methods. These problems coule be general, E.g., robustness of neural networks, low-resource learning. It could also be about a particular field: e.g., the language compositional problem in multi-hop reasoning. 
      2. Investigation of a problem:
          + What is the formal representation of the problem I am trying to solve?
          + Can I make some hypothesis and try to prove the hypothesis? 
      3. Propose solution of a problem/a set of problems. 
          + What is the essence of the problem I am trying to solve?
          + What methods I know can solve it? 
          + Can a newly available method solve this problem?
          + Can the problem be solved by some modifications/compositions of existing methods?
      4. Combination of (I, II, III). 
          + Usually the three process happens simultaneously. 

# Come up with Research Topics: 
Again the major types of papers are (1) new problems (2) the investigation of the problem (3) the solution to the problem and (4) the combination of (1, 2, 3). Now let's look at some examples how to actually come up with research ideas. Basically the research ideas could come out by going through all of the following points. 

- Start from an Unsolved Problem:
    - Start from an existing dataset
       + The possible topics are: investigation of this problem, solution to the problem, or both.
       + Here we look at an example of investigation + solution. 
       + 
    - Start from an existing dataset, but the new problem appears from our previously done work. 
       + The possible topics are: investigation of this problem, solution to the problem, or both.
       + Here is an example of pure investigation.
       + Here is an example of investigation + solution.
       + 
    - Start from general problems in machine learning and NLP, and see what can be done.
       + For example, the general problems in NLP are: model generalization/robustness, low-resource learning (few training data or limited computation resources), etc. 
       + The general problem in NLP include: semantic representation, reasoning, etc. 
       + Starting from these problem, the possible research directions are the Cartesian product of (existing dataset, new dataset) * (no investigation, investigation) * (no solution, solution). Next we enumerate a few examples. 
       + 
    - Other problems discusses in the papers (usually new papers)

- Start from an Existing Method:
